# Installation & Configuration

## Installation
This is an Angular 8 project, and you need to install the dependencies, and run the project. 

## Configuration
The application needs to be configured with the appropriate fields to be able to use it. Example configuration is provided in the `src/examples` folder.

### Environment Config

Key | Value
------------          | -------------
`baseUrl`             | Base URL for the Sunbird RC backend. Eg: https://registry.com/api
`schemaUrl`           | URL to the OpenAPI schema definition. This could be a HTTP path or a path to a local file Eg: https://registry.com/api/schema.json OR /assets/schema.json
`logo`                | URL to logo. This logo is displayed in the header of the UI


### Forms
The `forms.json` needs to be placed in `src/assets/config`. This file defines the schema for various forms used, along with the fields for each. The form rendering is based on the formly.dev library, and the forms.json is a small wrapper on top of the formly schema.

In this file `forms` is an array with key/value pairs. They key is the code / slug of the form which is used to access the form. Eg: if the key for a form is `employee-signup` that form can be accessed via `/forms/employee-signup`. Each form definition will have the below fields -

`form.api`            | This is the path to the API endpoints for the entity this form handles. Eg: `/Employer`
`form.type`           | Forms can be of 2 types. It can either be a form to create a new entity Eg: Employer, or it could be a form to submit a "sub-field" eg: work experience of an employee. For the former use `entity`. For the latter use `property:<property name>` (eg: property:work_experience)
`form.formclass`      | HTML Class applied to the form container
`form.title`          | Title of form

### Layouts
The `layouts.json` is used to define how the public and private profile pages look like. For each entity in OpenSaber backend, a layout file should be defined with the fields and the order in which they should display.
